## INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the foremost health challenges globally, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for effective intervention and management. Traditional diagnostic methods, while essential, often have limitations in sensitivity and specificity, particularly in the early stages of the disease.

Machine learning (ML) offers transformative potential in the field of cardiovascular disease detection. By leveraging vast amounts of healthcare data and sophisticated algorithms, ML can identify complex patterns and relationships within the data that may be imperceptible to human clinicians. This project aims to explore the application of machine learning techniques in enhancing the detection, diagnosis, and prediction of cardiovascular diseases
